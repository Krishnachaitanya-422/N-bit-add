# N-bit-add
This is a verilog design for n bit adder


The N-bit Adder is simply implemented by connecting 1 Half Adder and N-1 Full Adder in series. The Verilog code for N-bit Adder is designed so that the N value can be initialized independently for each instantiation.


I have achived the wave form for the sample inputs of
input1=1205=(4B5)16
input2=4555=(11CB)16

the output = 5760 ==> (1680)16.
